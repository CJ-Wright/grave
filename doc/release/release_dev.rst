Announcement: Grave 0.1
=======================

We're happy to announce the release of Grave 0.1!
Grave is a graph visualization package combining ideas from Matplotlib,
NetworkX, and seaborn.
Its goal is to provide a network drawing API that covers the most use cases
with sensible defaults and simple style configuration.
Currently, it supports drawing graphs from NetworkX.

and our `gallery of examples
<https://networkx.github.io/grave/latest/gallery/index.html>`_.
Please send comments and questions to the `networkx-discuss mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/networkx-discuss>`_.
